Welcome to Data Science Society's R Bootcamp

![](RStudio-Logo-Flat.jpg)


## Course Outline: 

__Installation__

What kind of data are we using?

__Reading in Data__

- BaseR and Tidyverse
- there's a from readr option using the "import dataset" option from the environment pane

__Wrangling Data__

- dplyr, for data manipulation
- tidyr, for data tidying
- cleaning, the difference between them all, and when they should all take place in the process

__Visualization of Data__

- the glory of ggplot

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
iris %>%
    ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species))+
    labs(
        title = "Title here",
        x = "Sepal Length", 
        y = "Sepal Width"
        )
```



## Ideas 

- Have a notes to instructors page or part of the repo
- have a page just for the interface of RStudio
  - hot keys
  - shortcuts
  - such and such
- have a page for R/Python equivalents
- have a page for other generally useful things
    - setting up R in VSCode: https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R or https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r or https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/Installation:-Windows
