Welcome to Data Science Society's R Bootcamp

<!-- ![](RStudio-Logo-Flat.jpg) -->


## Course Outline: 

The purpose of R Bootcamp is to be able to __read__, __wrangle__, and __visualize__ data using R in RStudio. By the end of the course you will be able to contribute to a society project next semester. 


### Reading Data: readr package

- navigating file systems
- copy file paths
- RStudio's "Import Dataset" button, "From Text (readr)" option

### Wrangling Data: dplyr/tidyr packages

__Primary Focus__: select, filter, mutate, groupby/summarise, and arrange.

__Secondary Focus__: joining, pivoting, case_when, 

__Other__: drop_na(), replace_na(), 


### Visualizing Data: ggplot2 package

- What kind of data these plot plot 
- code for each  
histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, bar charts.

In Terms of Packages: 

- readr
- dplyr/tidyr
- ggplot

Others: 

- forcats (fct_reorder and working with factors)
- stringr (working with text data)
- lubridate (working with dates) 
- tibble (just the tibble() function)
- purr (mappings, boring)





## What kind of data are we using?

We will mainly be using the _____ and the ____ datasets for practice. 

What is data? Is it singular or plural?

What other types of data are there? Take this for example ____

We will be working with tabular data. Other data includes pictures, videos, and audio. 

<br><br>




__readr__: for data import

__dplyr__: for data manipulation

__tidyr__: for data tidying

__ggplot2__: for data visualisation

__tibble__: for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames

__stringr__: for strings

__forcats__: for factors

__purrr__: for functional programming

\+

__lubridate__: for dates
