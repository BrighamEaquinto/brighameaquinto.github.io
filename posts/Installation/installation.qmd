# Second Comparison: R Script vs R Markdown (RMD)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=\"45%\"}
R scripts are more for crunching numbers when you do not intend on sharing the results. 

You can do exploratory data analysis (EDA) to become more familiar with your data like make summaries of the data, make graphs, and clean up a dataset.   
:::
::: {.column width=\"45%\"}
RMDs are for communicating your analysis. This allows you read in data, manipulate it, make graphs, and comment on the results. 

Here is an example from an [analysis on student housing](https://byuistats.github.io/Statistics-Notebook/Analyses/StudentHousing.html) )

(Later we'll talk about the new replacement to RMD's called [QMD's](https://quarto.org/)).
