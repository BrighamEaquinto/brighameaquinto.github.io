How to read in data so that we can use it: 

#### Reading in data that is located on your computer

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)

data1 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Bethany/Downloads/US_Population_200_Years.csv")
```



#### Getting data from a URL

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)

data1 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saundersg/Statistics-Notebook/master/Data/Rent.csv")

```


This will teach about how to get a dataset into RStudio so that we can use it. 

There are different types of data, we won't get into the nitty-gritty parts of it, but there is structured, semi-structured, and ustructured data. We will be playing around with structured data (think excel files). Examples of the other types of data are pictures, video, and audio files.
